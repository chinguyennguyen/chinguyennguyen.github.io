# Personal Projects

Welcome to my personal projects showcase! This page highlights some of the individual projects I've been working on outside of my academic research.

## About This Section

This is where I share projects that represent my interests, technical skills, and creative endeavors. The projects featured here may include:

- Software development projects
- Data analysis and visualization work
- Open source contributions
- Personal research initiatives
- Creative coding experiments

*This section will be expanded with specific projects as they are completed and ready for public sharing.*

*Check back regularly for updates as I continue to add new projects and expand existing ones.*
