Welcome! I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Gothenburg, with research interests at the intersection of labor economics and political economy. My work examines how individuals make choices under constraints — from marriage and intra-household bargaining to civic participation — using causal inference and machine learning methods. I enjoy translating complex data into clear policy recommendations and look forward to applying my statistical skills and economic theory insights to data science and analytics roles in industry.
